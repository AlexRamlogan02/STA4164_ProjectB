Project Title: Understanding Stress Factors for Engineering Students

Explaining Our Topic
1. Topic: Understanding Stress Factors for Engineering Students
- Why It Matters: We want to know what makes engineering students stressed. This can help us find ways to manage that stress.
2. Our Data 
-  What We Collected: We asked students about their sleep, headaches, academic performance, study load, extracurricular activities, and stress levels. They rated everything from 1 to 5.

Why It’s Good: This dataset is perfect. It’s easy to understand and has a few hundred answers, which meets our project requirements. We have 6 variables, so we’re all set.

3. Data Types
- Continuous and Categorical: We can use the ratings as categories (like stress levels) and even if we don’t have typical categorical data, we can still analyze these ratings.

 How This Project is Helpful 
	1. Understanding Stress: We will learn what makes engineering students feel stressed.
	2.Helping Students Feel Better: By finding out how sleep, headaches, and schoolwork affect stress, we can suggest ways to help students feel better.
	3. Support from Schools: Our project can help schools create programs to support students with stress.
	4. Better Choices: We can give tips to students and teachers on how to manage stress and study better.
	5. Future Studies: This work can lead to more research about student health and success.
